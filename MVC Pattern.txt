We have decided to use MVC architectural pattern for our web application primarily because of the possibility to build multiple views for models. It was more convenient for this type of application to use it since any modifications don't influence the whole model. We are constantly modifying and improving some of the UI as well as creating more views, so this pattern made it possible to be able to change layouts without touching the logic of the application. It also goes for possibility of changing the models without touching the UI, so again it decreases the bug "scope", we could immediately know where the bug happened.
